# Animate Any Line Plot

A lightweight Python tool for creating animated GIFs that visualize the
**evolution of a time series** by progressively revealing a line plot
from left to right along the x-axis.

This approach provides a clear and intuitive way to show how data
develops over time using a single, continuous animation.
